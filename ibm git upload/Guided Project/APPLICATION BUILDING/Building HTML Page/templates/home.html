                        Communication plays a significant role in making the world a better place. Communication creates bonding and relations among the people, whether personal, social, or political views. Most people communicate efficiently without any issues, but many cannot due to disability. They cannot hear or speak, which makes Earth a problematic place to live for them. Even simple basic tasks become difficult for them. Disability is an emotive human condition. It limits the individual to a certain level of performance. Being deaf and dumb pushes the subject to oblivion, highly introverted. In a world of inequality, this society needs empowerment. Harnessing technology to improve their welfare is necessary. In a tech era, no one should be limited due to his or her inability. The application of technology should create a platform or a world of equality despite the natural state of humans. On the other hand, technology is the most innovative thing on Earth for every time the clock ticks, researchers, software engineers, programmers, and information technology specialists are always coming up with bright ideas to provide convenience to everyone
                        This project shows how artificial intelligence is being used to help people who are unable to do what most people do in their everyday lives. This system provides detailed hand gestures that show the interpretation at the bottom so that everyone can understand them. 
    
                        This project helps a deaf and dumb people try to communicate with normal people without having any hesitation. Because generally deaf and dumb people have some sort of hesitate to interact with people.

                        Artificial Intelligence has made it possible to handle our daily activities
                        in new and simpler ways. With the ability to automate tasks that normally require human
                        intelligence, such as speech and voice recognition, visual perception, predictive text  functionality, decision-making, and a variety of other tasks, AI can assist people with
                        disabilities by significantly improving their ability to get around and participate in daily activities.<br><br>Currently, Sign Recognition is available <strong>only for alphabets A-I</strong> and not for J-Z, since J-Z alphabets also require Gesture Recognition for them to be able to be predicted correctly to a certain degree of accuracy.
